Train-Stations v1.0.3:

This Mod adds 2 new buildings. 1 Central train-station and 1 small train-station. The Central station "produces" travelers, which want to be driven to the small train-stations. If they are constantly supplied with travelers, they satisfy the market needs.

One Central train-station can supply up to 3 or 4 small train-stations, depending on logistical circumstances.

It is possible to combine both railway-systems: the oil-system and the traveler-system. The trains will transport both of them at the same time. But with seperate systems, the supply is more secured for all train-dependent buildings.

In addition the look of the train has been slightly modified and a wagon for transportation of travelers has been added.

The train-stations will be unlocked at 1000 engineers.

!!!This mod is compatible with already existing savegames. No Unlocker is needed!!!


After you installed the mod, you can find the train-stations in the added train-station-building-menu in the engineer-building-menu (train icon).


Update 1.0.3

  Bugfixes:
  
  - The Central Station, the train and the passenger-wagons always disappeared when you zoom out too far. This issue has now been resolved

  - new clock hands have been inserted at the main station, since the old ones have disappeared since patch 4.x.

  - the symbols which always appeared above the stations, if these are e.g. not connected to the oil port, now no longer be appearing (stations need no oil port!)

  - The bug that the stations supplied power to businesses has been fixed (electricity pylons are still appearing on the adjacent roads)


your faithfully
