As an Game-Design ships cant be turret based and side-cannon based at the same time. 
This Ship uses invisibly and limited turrets to archived the effect. 
Sadly it cannot fire booth side-cannons on different ships. But the max DPS can be reached when side firing.

Enjoy. If you have question or bugs, message me on discord. Ghostbuster#5062
